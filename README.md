**About Me:**

👋 Hi there! I'm Mamatha Dudakonda, a diligent and dedicated professional with a strong foundation in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. My academic journey includes a Bachelor of Technology degree from Dr. K.V. Subba Reddy College of Engineering for Women, where I achieved a commendable grade of 75.48%. Prior to that, I completed my Diploma in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Geetanjali College of Engineering & Technology with an outstanding score of 87.1%. My educational background has equipped me with a robust understanding of core concepts in my field. 🎓

In addition to my academic achievements, I possess a diverse skill set in both front-end and back-end technologies. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for front-end development, I also excel in Core Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), J2EE, Hibernate, Spring, and Spring Boot for back-end development. Furthermore, I am adept at managing databases, particularly MySQL. 💻

My passion for innovation and problem-solving led me to undertake an intriguing academic project titled "IoT Integrated Distribution Power Grid Losses with Automatic Tracking Location using Decision Tree Algorithm" in 2020. This project not only showcased my technical abilities but also demonstrated my ability to tackle real-world challenges in the realm of electrical distribution systems. 🛠️

Building on my academic foundation, I embarked on a transformative journey as a Software Development Intern at KodNest Technologies in Bangalore. During my tenure from June 2023 to January 2024, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in Java, Full Stack development, and SQL. Working alongside industry professionals, I contributed to meaningful projects, honing my skills and broadening my understanding of software development practices. 💼

In recognition of my dedication to continuous learning and professional development, I have obtained certifications in Java Programming and Java Full Stack Development. These certifications validate my expertise and commitment to staying abreast of industry trends and advancements. 🏅

Driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence, I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to a forward-thinking organization. With a passion for innovation and a penchant for overcoming challenges, I am poised to thrive in dynamic and collaborative environments, where my contributions can make a tangible impact. 🔍✨
